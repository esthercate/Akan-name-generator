# Akan Name Generator

## Project Description

In Ghana and many parts of West Africa, a person's name is derived from the day of the week on which he/she was born. 
The Akan Name Generator is a web application that takes your birthday details, calculates the day of the week that you were born, then depending on your gender, it outputs your Akan Name.
